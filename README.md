### What is PregnaCare?
  PregnaCare is a device for early detection of pregnancy abnormalities based on heartrate, SpO2 level, blood sugar level, and body temperature. It uses a max30102 sensor to collect heartrate and SpO2 level and DS18B20 sensor for body temperature. Blood sugar level is gathered through regression of the heartrate and SpO2 data. The data is then displayed on a website. Along with the data, the website also displays the condition of the pregnancy based on AI prediction, a history chart of all the data gathered, and also a chatbot as a place to ask any questions concerning pregnancy.
